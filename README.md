# ExperimentsWithAI

This repo holds an Unreal Engine project created for the purpose ofcompleting tutorials and experimenting with various AI features within the Unreal Engine framework.

To date this project includes:
* work with the Navigation Bounds Volume and basic AI driven blueprints that pursue and attack the player
* experiments on pawn possession and character switching
* working with Behavior Trees and Unreals' Environment Query System

This project will continue to grow in size and complexity as I learn more advanced techniques for implementing AI driven game features.
